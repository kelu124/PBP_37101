What I will ask you, is, based on texts I will subsequently share with you, to extract what the main pairs (one element from Group A, one from Group B) for this text are.
Your answer needs to take the form of a list (as long as possible - try to get either at least 30 elements or until you reach a Score of 40) of bullet points, under the form:
* (GroupAelement, GroupBelement, Score, Justification, Scale)
 where groupAelement and GroupBelement are the codes of the topics, score a value between 0 and 100 capturing how relevant (100 is the max) the pair is, and 'justification' is a single phrase that details why you chose this pair.
for example
* (A.1, A.2, 90, "Justification", SCALE)
SCALE is a single word, and can _only_ be "Building" or "Neighbourhood", nothing else. You can also consider that a specific point or sentence can cover different pairs.
